# MilordShortcuts
a bunch of batch shortcuts to make dev stuff really quick (example: git commit -m "stuff"  -> gitmit "stuff")

In order to use these shortcuts, all you need to do is add the repo folder to your PATH after cloning it.
That will make all these batch files available to your command prompt. Enjoy the shortcuts :)

-- TO USE the shortcuts `dev`, ``, and `` --
You have to create a `config.ini` file with the specific information

file should be structured as:

```
[dev]
value="project\folder\path\here"
[ssh]
value="domainforssh.here"
```

Thats it!
